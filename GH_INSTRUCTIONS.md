# Steps to push to GitHub

Since we don't have the GitHub CLI available, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.com:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name the repository "flexibleDataTable"
   - Make it public or private according to your preference
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Copy the repository URL shown on the next page

3. In your terminal, add the remote and push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   
   Replace YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL with the URL from step 2, which will look like:
   - HTTPS: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flexibleDataTable.git
   - SSH: git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/flexibleDataTable.git

4. Verify your repository contains all the files on GitHub.com
